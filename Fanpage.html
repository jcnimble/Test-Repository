                <h2>Bio</h2>

                    <p>The Go-Go's are an American new wave band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1978. The Go-Go's rose to fame during the early 1980s and were the first, and to date only, all-female band that both wrote their own songs and played their own instruments to top the Billboard album charts.</P>
                        
                    <p>Their 1981 debut album, Beauty and the Beat, is considered one of the "cornerstone albums of US new wave" (AllMusic), breaking barriers and paving the way for a host of other new American acts. When the album was released, it steadily climbed the Billboard 200 chart, ultimately reaching No. 1, where it remained for six consecutive weeks. The album sold over 2 million copies and went double platinum,[3] making it one of the most successful debut albums of all time. The Go-Go's have sold over 7 million records worldwide</p>
                        
                    <p>The Go-Go's broke up in 1985, but reconvened several times through the 1990s and beyond, recording new material and touring. Though their 2016 performances were billed as a farewell tour, the band remains active on a sporadic ad hoc basis, most recently with three performances at The Hollywood Bowl in July 2018</p>
